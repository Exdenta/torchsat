    This loss was introduced in "Tversky loss function for image segmentation using 3D fully convolutional deep networks", 
    retrievable here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05721. It was designed to optimise segmentation on imbalanced medical datasets 
    by utilising constants that can adjust how harshly different types of error are penalised in the loss function.

    To summarise, this loss function is weighted by the constants 'alpha' and 'beta' that penalise false positives and false negatives 
    respectively to a higher degree in the loss function as their value is increased. The beta constant in particular has applications 
    in situations where models can obtain misleadingly positive performance via highly conservative prediction. You may want to experiment 
    with different values to find the optimum. With alpha==beta==0.5, this loss becomes equivalent to Dice Loss.
